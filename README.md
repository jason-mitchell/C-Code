This is my AES-128 implementation that I use in my code.
Why my own, you might ask? 
The answers are:

1. This code was peer reviewed

2. It has been used to encrypt firmware images and was used to build my secure HCS08 bootloader.

3. It hasn't been compromised to the best of my knowledge

4. It is lightweight

5. It has been recently proven again, to be secure, reliable, efficient, with NFC ticketing applications.
